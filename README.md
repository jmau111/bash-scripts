# Bash Scripts

Various Bash that used to be separate repos. All-In-One repo!

## How to use submodules

You may need the following command if it's your first clone of the project:

```
git clone git@github.com:jmau111/bash-scripts.git && cd bash-scripts
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Otherwise, you may download each script one by one.

## How to execute the scripts

Clone the project or download the script you want and use `chmod +x [ SCRIPT_FILE ]` to make executable. 

Then you can do `./[ SCRIPT_FILE ]`.

Alternatively, you can use `bash [ SCRIPT_FILE ]`
